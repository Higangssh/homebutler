# Web Dashboard

`homebutler serve` starts an embedded web dashboard — no Node.js, no Docker, no extra dependencies. The entire Svelte frontend is compiled into the Go binary at build time using `go:embed`.

```bash
homebutler serve                # http://localhost:8080
homebutler serve --port 3000    # custom port
```

Access from another machine via SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@your-server
# Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
